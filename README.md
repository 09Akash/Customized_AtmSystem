## Customized Atm System
Welcome to the Customized ATM System project! This project is developed in Java using the Swing framework to simulate a basic ATM experience with additional custom features. The primary purpose of this project is to explore and understand how an ATM operates on the backend, including managing user transactions, handling accounts, and implementing essential ATM functionalities.
## Features
User Authentication:  
Users can securely log in using their unique credentials, ensuring only authorized access to their account.

Balance Inquiry:
 Users can check their current balance, providing real-time updates of account status.

Cash Withdrawal: 
Allows users to withdraw specific amounts, with checks to ensure funds availability.

Deposit: 
Users can deposit funds into their account, which will instantly reflect in the balance.

Transaction History: 
Tracks recent transactions to provide users with their latest account activity.

Customizable Account Types :
 Set different types of accounts (e.g., Savings, Current) 

Error Handling and Alerts: 
Informs users of any errors or issues, such as insufficient funds or incorrect PIN entry.

## Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language for implementing backend and frontend logic.

Swing Framework: Used for creating the GUI, making it easier to simulate a real ATM interface.

## Usage
Once you run the project, you will see an ATM interface window where you can:

   1. Log in using pre-set credentials.
   2. Access your account to view balance, withdraw,  deposit, and check transaction history.
   3. Log out to end the session securely.
   4. This can be expanded to include more advanced banking functionalities as needed.

## Future Enhancements
   1. Database Integration: Store user data and transaction records in a database for persistent storage.
   2.  Multi-User Support: Support multiple users with different accounts and credentials.
3.  Enhanced Security: Implement encrypted data storage and handling.
   4. Additional Features: Add functionality for funds transfer, bill payments, and other banking services.
